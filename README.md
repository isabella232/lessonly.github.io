### Blog Posts

It's always good to get a second opinion when writing a new post to make sure it is relevant. Consider asking the team in chat if they think your new post topic on, "My Ruby Kittens gem. Awww cute" is something we can inspire other developers to read.

1. jekyll post "My new draft name"
2. Write your post
3. When you are finished push your changes up to a new PR
4. Let the team know the post is ready for content editing
